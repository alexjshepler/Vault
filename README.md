# Vault

User will enter their username and password that will act as the salt and password for the encryption/decryption algorithm. If they enter the correct username and password they will be able to access their files as normal, but if they enter an incorrect username and password combo the decryption algorithm will decrypt the files based on the username and password resulting in scrambeled data.

All of the files will be in one directory when looking at the "vault" outside of the program, and there will be one file that stores the file and direcotry paths as a graph
